# SpatialAudioDev
My goal for this project is to create a spatial audio system that allows people who have normal, wired headphones to experience spatial audio that is calibrated to their movements. This system mimics Interaural Time and Level Differences using audio level balancing (level and right audio channels). This requires a calibration of hardware that tracks the movements of the user, and software that converts the inputs into audio levels for left and right ears (through headphones) to provide an emulation of audio placed in an environment. 

In this product, the device sourcing the audio will be the laptop connected to headphones. I’ll be using a hat with a “brain” that holds the necessary components to track the user’s head movements and relay the data to the computer to process and output spatially-emulated audio using audio level balancing.
